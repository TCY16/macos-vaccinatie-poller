# macos-vaccinatie-poller

Note, this only works on **MacOS** currently.

1. Change path to the location of "greensquare.png" (for example, ~/Downloads/greensquare.png)
2. Change year to your birthyear
3. Run the program (and keep it running), and when the green square shows up, rush to the vaccination website!
